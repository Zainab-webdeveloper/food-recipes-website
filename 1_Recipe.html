    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="list">
        <li>1 cup small pasta </li>
        <li>4 cups high-quality Chicken or Vegetable Broth </li>
        <li>1/4 cup Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>1 Large Egg </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Ground Black Pepper </li>
        <li>Pinch of Salt </li>
        <li>Optional garnish: Fresh parsley or chives, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <p class="list">In a medium saucepan, bring the broth to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Add the small pasta. Cook, stirring
    often, until the pasta is al dente and most of the liquid is absorbed (about 6-8 minutes, check pasta package
    directions). You want it slightly saucy, not completely dry.While pasta cooks, in a separate small pan, melt the
    butter over medium-low heat. Add the minced garlic and cook gently for 2-3 minutes until fragrant and slightly
    golden (do not brown or burn).Turn off the heat under the pasta. Immediately stir in the cooked garlic butter,
    grated Parmesan cheese, black pepper, and salt (if needed).If using the egg, whisk it lightly in a small bowl.
    Crucially, to prevent scrambling, add 1-2 tablespoons of the hot pasta mixture into the whisked egg, stirring
    constantly, to temper it. Then, immediately pour the tempered egg mixture into the hot pasta, stirring vigorously
    and quickly until fully incorporated and the pasta becomes wonderfully creamy. The residual heat will cook the egg.
    Serve immediately in warm bowls, topped with extra freshly grated Parmesan and a sprinkle of fresh herbs if desired.
    <b>Enjoy!</b> </p>
